## Welcome to CarlosFTM Firmware Projects

Here I will publish the firmware code for different projects for development platforms based on STM32, RP2040, ESP32 and others.

### Why another Github?

The idea is to share some useful code that could be reused on different projects. Trying to keep it as portable as possible (hardware independent) by abstracting the access to hardware.
Another aspect that makes this project different is that the main focus is the use of software engineering concepts that in such small projects are normally not used.
So here you will not find examples of high-performance or optimized code that makes the most efficient use of the harware resources. Here you may find, for example, how to access a GPIO, ADC or other hardware elements making use of a finite state machine, scheduler, queues, semaphores, mutex, etc.

#### Thank you for following and have fun coding
